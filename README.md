This is packages-only organisation for [gradle-api](https://github.com/remal-gradle-plugins/gradle-api).

[GitHub documentations](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/deleting-and-restoring-a-package#package-deletion-and-restoration-support-on-github) says:
> You cannot delete a public package if any version of the package has more than 25 downloads.

That's why a separate packages-only organisation was created. It allows to recreate the organisation and, by doing that, remove its packages.

All issues and pull requests are expected to be created in [gradle-api](https://github.com/remal-gradle-plugins/gradle-api) repository only.
